# Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction — Demo Project

### 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a **Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction model**, inspired by Cadent’s mission to optimize media performance through data-driven intelligence.
Using the **Avazu dataset**, I built a machine learning pipeline that predicts the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad impression.

The goal is to showcase practical experience with **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (AUC), and explainability**, following the **CRISP-DM process**.

### 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [Avazu Click-Through Rate Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction)

* 24 features describing ad impressions, devices, sites, and timing.
* Target variable: `click` (1 = user clicked, 0 = no click)

---

### 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**

   * Extracted day and hour from the encoded `hour` column.
   * Dropped high-cardinality identifiers (`device_ip`, `device_id`).
   * Label-encoded categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Derived temporal features (`dayofweek`, `hourofday`).
   * Prepared balanced training/validation sets.

3. **Modeling**

   * Trained a **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** model for classification.
   * Evaluated using **ROC-AUC** to measure ranking performance.
   * Used **SHAP** for model explainability.

4. **Deployment (optional)**

   * Prepared modular pipeline code for potential API integration.

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3.11**
* **Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP**
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualizations)
* **PyCharm IDE**
* **(Optional)** Streamlit for interactive demo UI

---

### 📈 Results

* Model achieved **AUC ≈ 0.73** on test data.
* Key predictive features: `banner_pos`, `device_type`, `hourofday`, and `site_category`.
* Model interpretability added with SHAP for transparency and governance.
